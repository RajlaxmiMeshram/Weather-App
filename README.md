# React Weather App
 This application allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific city. The weather data is fetched from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and the app displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.
## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:</br>
   - ```` git clone https://github.com/RajlaxmiMeshram/Weather-App.git````
2. Install dependencies:
   -  ````npm install````
3. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace the placeholder in weatherApp.jsx with your API key.
4. Start the development server:
   -  ````npm start````
5. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
